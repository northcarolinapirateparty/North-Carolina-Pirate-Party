                            <p id="intro">The North Carolina Pirate Party is an emerging political party in North Carolina that we are seeking to revive. Our platform is aligned with the
                                International Pirate Movement. We support digital and intellectual reform, government
                                transparency, and protection of privacy and civil liberties.

                                We do most of our organizing on Discord. Check out or <a href="#platform">platform</a> and <a href="#join">Join us!</a></p>

                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Putting People Before Corporations</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">The Supreme Court and Congress have expanded the power of corporations for over a hundred years
                            and made them more powerful than people. Whether it is the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision
                            that allows corporations to buy elections, or Congress' cuts in corporate tax rates while raising
                            payroll taxes, real people end up with the short end of the stick. The Pirate Party will make sure
                            our laws put people before corporations.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Opening up Government</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">In order for citizens to control their democratic destiny, we need to know what our government is
                            doing and which special interests are influencing our public elected officials.
                            Increasingly government officials ignore open meeting laws, make deals favorable to corporations
                            behind closed doors and sell off your public information to private interests. Some state laws
                            prevent people from recording public officials in their duties, such as a police officer making an
                            arrest, but the police cameras can record your actions without your permission. The Pirate Party
                            will make sure that our government is transparent and accountable to the people.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Defending Your Privacy</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">Whether it was the PATRIOT ACT, illegal NSA wiretapping or local surveillance cameras,
                            our government has used 9/11 to increase its surveillance and control over us. 
                            Corporations have increased their spying on employees in order to get more work out of them.
                            The arguments for each step on the road to a surveillance state may sound convincing,
                            but that road leads to less control by people and more by government and corporate elites.
                            Terrorists may attack the open society, but only governments can abolish it.
                            The Pirate Party will prevent that from happening.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Promoting Culture & Knowledge Through Copyright Reform</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">The Founding Fathers created our copyright laws to promote knowledge & culture by giving the creator
                            a limited monopoly over their creations. Congress, under the influence of corporations, has extended
                            the duration of that government granted monopoly to seventy years after the death of the creator.
                            Increasingly corporations have sought broader laws to ensure that they control and profit from more
                            of our culture. Through Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies they have locked down our culture,
                            hindered sharing and criminalized their customers.
                            The Pirate Party will:
                            <ul style="padding-left:100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                                <li>limit the copyright to five years for electronic media and fourteen years for tangible objects,
                                </li>
                                <li>make sure that all non-commercial copying, sharing and remixing are legal and ban DRM software.
                                </li>
                                <li>There is no reason for copyright to continue until 70 years after death.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">Everyone must have equal access to the internet, and the Pirate Party will foster
                            network neutrality so that internet service providers cannot give preferential treatment to preferred
                            web sites and we oppose three strikes laws that ban anyone from using the internet because of
                            copyright violations.  The internet has the potential to be a new Library of Alexandria, if we don't
                            let corporations and government lock it down.
                        </p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Fostering Innovation by Abolishing Patents</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We seek the abolition of patents. The patent system stifles innovation by making it difficult to
                            incorporate an existing invention into a new one. It discourages researchers from sharing
                            their new ideas until after a patent application. It prevents hundreds of thousands of people
                            in poor countries from receiving the drugs they need. Currently pharmaceutical companies spend
                            only 15% of their revenue on new drug research. The remaining 85% is spent on activities such
                            as marketing and profit taking. A reformed system would dramatically increase the money
                            available for innovation, while removing the obstacles to innovation posed by the current
                            patent system.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Police Reform</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We believe that major police reform is not only a legitimate idea, but a necessity. Due to the divisive and hot button nature of this topic, the USPP is dedicated to finding quality solutions that can be agreed upon by the vast majority. Here are a few steps we can take towards reform:
                            <ul style="padding-left:100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                                <li>Demilitarize the police through actions such as ending the 1033 Program and discouraging technique sharing between the neighborhood police and the military or federal intelligence agencies;
                                </li>
                                <li>End qualified immunity and hold officers accountable when they break the law;
                                </li>
                                <li>End civil asset forfeiture and its enabling of “slush funds” to be used for any purpose;
                                </li>
                                <li>Invest money into community care instead of more policing, especially in areas currently impacted by over-policing;
                                </li>
                                <li>Require warrants for all forms of surveillance and end no-knock warrants;
                                </li>
                                <li>Force departments to collect statistics in order to outline biases in enforcement and which enforcement methods are better for the community;
                                </li>
                                <li>Ensure nobody is put in jail for actions of basic survival;
                                </li>
                                <li>Properly train our police forces with regular training in all aspects of the job. This will include but not limited to mental health assessments, first responder medical certification, community policing, & public engagement.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">
                            There are many things that must be done in order to fix the issues with policing in our country. There are also many different end goals that many different people have in mind. What we need right now is an honest, no-nonsense start to the process, and that is what the USPP hopes to achieve.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Bigotry</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We proudly condemn bigotry as irrational and repugnant. We believe this behavior to be fundamentally incompatible with our core values. Pirates stand for everyone, even when others do not.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Pan-Americanism</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">Continents have been united in various ways, such as Europe in the form of the EU, Africa with the AU, or Southeast Asia with ASEAN. While the existence of the OAS (Organization of American States) signifies a previous willingness to come together in the name of Pan-Americanism, a restructuring from a paradigm of United States dominance to genuine collaboration and friendship is essential. A more united American Continent will help each country become stronger and create a stronger bond between every American, from Greenland to Patagonia.
                            <ul style="padding-left:100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                                <li>We advocate for increased diplomacy in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean, especially where we do not have a good record of friendly and diplomatic relations. We need to earn the trust of our fellow American countries in the New World by being a helpful ally rather than an overarching imperial authority.
                                </li>
                                <li>We advocate for increasing trade and signing friendship treaties with these countries in order to assist them economically, helping to bolster the continent's economy in general, and strengthening our cultural ties as Americans.
                                </li>
                                <li>We call for free movement for Americans from every American country.
                                </li>
                                <li>We advocate for ending the Cuban embargo and lifting sanctions on Nicaragua and Venezuela.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">It's no secret that the treatment of Latin Americans and other ethnic/cultural minorities within these United States have been less than stellar. There will be high expectations if we claim that we have changed for the better, and rightfully so. It will take years of work to repair the damaged relationships and restore continental trust back in the USA and its citizens, but that is something we here at the US Pirate Party, joined in partnership with Pirate Parties on the American continent, are committed to doing.</p>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Foreign Policy</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We call for the free movement of all peoples.
                            <ul style="padding-left:100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                                <li>We advocate for the right to free association and self-determination. People living in a political entity should have the right to maintain, alter or conclude their relationship to larger entities, or join in union, if it is the will of the people.
                                </li>
                                <li>We advocate for lifting sanctions on countries who only have said sanctions because we disapprove of their government.
                                </li>
                                <li>We advocate for legislation which ensures our government and intelligence agencies do not interfere in any elections in Europe, Africa, Asia or any part of the American Continent and that the will of the people is respected.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">This would likely require quite a significant foreign policy change on the USA's part, however. The US has made a lot of missteps along the way, so we should make the first steps to fix them.</p>                      
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px; color: #">Gun Rights And Gun Control</h2>
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We fully and completely support the individual right to bear arms laid out in the 2nd Amendment. That any attempt to assert that it is not a right for the people, but rather for the government, its military, national guard, corporations, etc, is incongruent and dishonest. That it is a right for everyone to exercise especially in these dangerous times. People of Color, Lgbtq+, minorities, everyone must be able to defend themselves should the administration start to try them as they did Garcia which is completely unacceptable in any manner that is American. The 2nd amendment is not some secondary or even third level right. It is on the same level as the rest of the nine and needs to be treated as such.
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We recognize that mass shootings are a problem in this country and no sane person will sit by and say it is just a part of American Life. That’s just an unacceptable proposition. Especially when mass shootings only got worse after Columbine, not relatively before.
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">However, a lot of gun control proposals that have been proposed, such as assault weapon bans or increasing the age to buy/own a gun or registries of all gun owners, are not interested in stopping mass shootings but rather taking as many guns out of circulation as possible if not all, limiting if not restricting gun access and just red meat for the voting base that wants a Free Gun America. Which to many gun owners, especially single issue gun owners, is a canary in the coal mine and just a nonstarter for obvious reasons that just pushes them right into the arms of the GOP.
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">We cannot aim to solve the epidemic of mass shootings and only propose solutions that volatile the right to bear arms in the process with no proper lines in the sand drawn as to where this all ends and expect Gun Owners to not be hostile.
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">And many gun control proposals are incompatible with our desire for police reform. One can not heavily criticize the police for their actions, lack of accountability and police brutality with at best a bare minimum of regard for citizens rights. And then in the same breath want to give such authoritarian powers that many gun control proposals would give them. If the police are the horrid enforcement agency that we criticize them for, then why give them more power and authority through gun control? It’s just inconsistent and incompatible.
                        <p style="padding-left: 70px; padding-right: 70px;">With that said, our solutions for mass shootings are as follows:
                            <ul style="padding-left:100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                                <li>A Comprehensive subsidiary and guideline program for mass media, from Fox News to CNN to PBS, to responsibly cover mass shootings without going into 24/7 constant news coverage that will just inspire other mass shooters. Many studies have confirmed a link between constant mass media coverage and mass shootings mainly because mass shootings fall into the same problem as copycat suicides. They are not new. They are done with the intention of attention and fame or in this case infamy. In other words, copycat mass killings. We need to treat these shooters as the nsignificant bugs as they are and have the media responsibly cover them instead of giving them the infamy that they want. We are not interested in trying to protect the 2nd Amendment just to violate the First and vice versa. It shouldn’t have to be one or the other here.
                                </li>
                                <li>Mental Health programs aimed toward Men and young teen boys to help cope with their mental health issues. And supporting healthcare change and universal healthcare. We cannot say that Mass Shootings is a mental health problem and then not mean it by refusing healthcare changes or universal healthcare. It’s just trying to handwave the problem which isn’t acceptable.
                                </li>
                                <li>Actual compromises with Gun Owners instead of half baked false promises. In order to stop mass shootings, both sides need to come together for better, not false promises disguised as compromises.
                                </li>
                                <li>Remove zero tolerance policies in schools. Even if it does nothing, it’s long overdue to get rid of it for more than just the one reason. It’s a win win regardless.
                                </li>
                                <li>Fix inequality in this country. The evidence on this is clear cut that inequality drives crimes. Naturally, when the inequality gap is significantly shrunk, less crime will come and logically less mass shootings will come.
                                </li>
                                <li>Look into operation ceasefire and the omaha violence prevention program to see how and what can be replicated and used on a national scale.
