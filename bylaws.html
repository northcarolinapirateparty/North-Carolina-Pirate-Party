            <p id="intro">1.A. – Name – The name of this organization is the North Carolina Pirate Party (NCPP).</p>
            <p id="intro">1.B. – Purpose and Mission – The purpose of the North Carolina Pirate Party is to continue the international Pirate movement and help it grow in the state of North Carolina. Our mission is to make political change at the local and state level, and promote the Core Values set out in the bylaws of the United States Pirate Party, which is the national party of the NCPP.</p>
            <p id="intro">1.C. – Core Values – As established by the United States Pirate Party, we uphold our Core Values. In addition, the North Carolina Pirate Party includes two values (#8 & #9) pertaining to our state party:</p>        
                <ul style="padding-left:100px; padding-right: 100px;">
                    <ol type="1">   
                    <li>We stand for free and open culture. No one should have the power to prevent the free exchange and expression of ideas, tools, or works.</li>
                    <li>We stand for transparency and openness. Government activities should not be hidden from the public.</li>
                    <li>We stand for individual privacy. The amount of oppression in a society is inversely proportional to its privacy protections. Individuals must be free to make personal decisions that do not harm another person.</li>
                    <li>We are anti-monopoly. No monopoly should be able to prevent works, tools, or ideas from: being freely used, expressed, exchanged, recombined, or taught; nor to violate individual privacy or human rights. A creator’s right to be compensated for their work or idea is only acceptable within these limitations.</li>
                    <li>We stand for individuals over institutions. Universal human rights apply only to human beings, and not to corporations, limited liability organizations, or other group entities.</li>
                    <li>We are a post-ideological values-based meritocracy. We place all options on the table. We choose a specific approach because the available evidence shows that it is the best way to promote our values. We do not make decisions based merely on tradition, popularity, authority or political expediency.</li>
                    <li>We are egalitarian. We believe in equality and a level playing field. We accept input from all sources, and we value all people equally.</li>
                    <li>We are anti-discrimination. Any discriminatory attitudes based on a person’s race, gender, sexual orientation, age or any applicable, non-controllable factor shall not be tolerated.</li>
                    <li>We believe in a market place of ideas. No political stance is too obscure or too outrageous to discuss. All ideas shall be discussed in an honest, serious and open matter to allow the greatest possibility of understanding and acceptance in our democratic processes.</li>
                    <li>We actively practice these values. We hold ourselves accountable for our own adherence to these principles.</li>
